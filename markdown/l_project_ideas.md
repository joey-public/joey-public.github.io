# Project Ideas

## Website

- Make a Neovim Plugin for website linking easier
- Add a format_site.py script to format my markdown before generating the html
    - links in my md files will be `<path_to_site>/markdown/<file_name>.md`. The formatting script should replace these paths with `<path_to_site>/html/<file_name>.html
    - format_site.py should also automatically update the `index.html` to make a TOC style page with my different posts.
