# Pairing Logitech k380 with ubuntu

Follow instructions found [here](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/590221/pairing-logitech-k380-in-ubuntu-20-04)

# Notes

Make sure the K380 is in pairing mode first, by holding down one of the 3 pairing buttons until the light is blinking quickly.

When using the `scan on` command it can take a little bit of time. Eventually you will see the `k380` or `logitech` or `keyboard somewhere in the scan.

Before trusting the device, double check you have the correct device id with the `info <dev-id>` command. You should see refrences to the K380 in that info string if you have the correct id.

You can use the `untrust` command to remove trust from any device.

After the `pair <dev-id>` commnand **type the passcode with the K380** not the laptop keyboard.
