## A Calendar of Wisdom by Leo Tolstoy 

### Quote 1
**Wise consumption is much more complicated than wise production. What five people will produce, one person can very easily consume, and the question for each individual and for every nation is not how we are to produce, but how are are producers to be consumed.** - John Ruskin

I find this quote strongly relevant today in the age of the internet. With a computer in my pocket and a constant connection to an essentially infinite amount of media to consume, I find it challenging and complicated to decide what to even consume. When I am creating something, I usually put though into it and take my time, but when I consume media I often turn my brain off and mindlessly scroll the internet. Sometimes I just need a break and this is ok, but overtimes I regret it and feel like I am simply wasting my limited time.  


As an individual it is my responsibility to choose what I consume, and how I consume it. I know this and its something I have though about before. 

Also if I create things it is my responsibility to consider how my products will be consumed. I want to create things that people enjoy.

### Quote 2
**You can torture people; you can treat them as if they were animals; you can abuse them in all ways; you can kill them as if they were summer flies. But people will remain free in the highest sense because they have eternal souls.** - John Ruskin
