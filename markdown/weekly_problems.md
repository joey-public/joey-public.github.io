# Weekly Problems 

## Week 1: Microelectronic Circuits, Sedra / Smith 

**Problems:** 

*1.3:* Illustrate the composition of a square wave signal by sketching the first four terms of the series given in Eq. 1.2 and then performing a grahical summation.


*1.4:* For a square wave audio signal of 10 Khz, what fraction of the available energy is perceived by an average listerener of age 40 whose hearing extends only to 16 Khz?


*1.5* Numerically evaluate the series expansion for a square wave given in Eq 1.2 truncated after 4 terms at $t = T/8, T/4,$ and $3T/4$.

$$
v(t) = \frac{4V}{\pi}
    \left(\sin(\omega_0 t) + \frac{1}{3} \sin(3\omega_0 t)
     + \frac{1}{5} \sin(5\omega_0 t) + ...\right) \tag{Eq 1.2}
$$
