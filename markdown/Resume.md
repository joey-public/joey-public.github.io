Experience  
**Electrical Engineer**, NIWC Pacific – San Diego , Ca			August 2018 – Present

* As an  analog ASIC designer, I designed several voltage references and bias circuits in a wide variety of technology nodes. I was the lead designer for a bandgap voltage reference on 3 seperate successful tape-outs. I am responsible for Cadence circuit designs, simulation, and layout.  
* As an embedded engineer I am responsible for porting a small machine learning model onto a Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller. I modified an existing sample project using tensorflow lite and the Pico C/C++ SDK to meet the project requirements.    
* As a circuit designer, I worked on a boost converter for energy harvesting applications. This included updating an old design, running LT-SPice simulations, designing a new PCB with Altium, and testing the fabricated boards. 

Projects  
**Collared Lizard Localization**			April 2023 – June 2023

* Worked with UCSD’s Engineers for Exploration group to build a proof of concept system for localizing the position of collared lizards.   
* The system consisted of a radio transmitter and 4 software defined radios.   
* Using the Ettus Research UHD libraries our team created a C++ application that ran on the USRP radios to receive and timestamp the transmitter signal before sending the resits to a central computer to perform localization calculations and determine the position of the transmitter.

**OFDM Modem Simulation**			December 2022– March 2023

* Using Python Created a Simulation of an OFDM Modulator and Demodulator.   
* Created a script named my\_ofdm.py that includes all the functions used for modulating and demodulating OFDM signals, and some useful utility functions.   
* Using my custom functions demonstrated demodulation of an unknown signal corrupted by a channel.   
* Demodulation steps include frequency offset estimations using the Schmidl Cox algorithm, timing offset estimations using a correlation with a known training sequence, and channel estimation and correction in the frequency domain.

**IOT Habitat Monitor**			December 2021 – March 2022

* Designed a System that measures the temperature, humidity, and brightness in several locations at once using PYNQ Z2 dev boards connected to the Adafruit Cloud.   
* Used Arduinos as sensor boards to interface with temperature and humidity sensors.   
* Created a generic I2C sensor class that was extended to interface each unique sensor with the PYNQ board.   
* Implemented a concurrent programming python application where each PYNQ Z2 can run a client and server application on an isolated processor. The client application additionally includes multithreading to handle user input (button presses), reading sensor data, and blinking LEDs in parallel.
