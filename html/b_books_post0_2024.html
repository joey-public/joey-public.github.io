<h1>2024 Books</h1>
<p>Here are a list of the books I have read since buying my Kindle in July of 2024. I ranked them in order of my favorite to least favorite, but I enjoyed all of them enough to finish, which is more then I can say for the many other books that I started then stopped reading this year. I want to eventually do short write ups on each book I read, but so far I have not done that. Maybe in the future I can come back and write about each of these books if I have time.  </p>
