<h1>Title</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In this series of blog posts I want to document my progression as I design and update my own personal website. In this post I will brainstorm the features I want in my website. </p>
<p>I want to keep things as simple as possible, including avoiding using any form of website generators. I like making things from scratch as much as is reasonable, this way I can learn more, get first some practice programming new things, and build exactly the tools I want and need. </p>
<p>If nothing else I will just walk away with an appreciation for why I should use a site generator like <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> or <a href="https://gohugo.io/">hugo</a>. </p>
<h2>Requirements</h2>
<ul>
<li>I can Host the site on GitHub pages</li>
<li>Blog Style Pages should be written in Markdown then converted to html <ul>
<li>Be able to generate the website with a single command line call</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Styling can be manually with css style sheets. </li>
<li>Any more complicated pages can be manually written with html/css. </li>
<li>Minimal to no JavaScript so I can learn basic HTML and CSS to start</li>
</ul>
<h2>Hosting the site</h2>
<p>I host this site using <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Github Pages</a>. This is an easy and free way to host the website directly from its github repository and is a great fit for my goals. </p>
<h2>Folder Structure</h2>
<p>The file structure of my site will look like this:</p>
<pre><code>my_site
----index.html
----markdown/
----html/
----images/
----templates/
</code></pre>
<h2>Naming Conventions</h2>
<p>I should come up with a strict naming convention for files so that its easy to organize everything. For starters:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>index.html</code> is the main entry point for the site</li>
<li>All markdown files go in the markdown directory and follow a naming convention like this: <code>&lt;type_id&gt;_&lt;series_name&gt;_&lt;post#&gt;_&lt;note&gt;.md</code> <ul>
<li><code>type_id</code> is a code for the type of page, for example <code>b</code> for a blog post</li>
<li><code>series name</code> is the name of the topic this series of pages is about</li>
<li><code>post#</code> defines the post number on the topic</li>
<li><code>note</code> is an optional description of the file</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>All html files go in the html directory and have the same name as the markdown file that they were generated from, but with an html file extension</li>
</ul>
<p>I should make another post sometime to flesh out the file naming conventions as far as what <code>type_ids</code> I want to include for now here is a super short idea list</p>
<ul>
<li><code>b</code>$\rightarrow$ a blog </li>
<li><code>t</code>$\rightarrow$ a tutorial </li>
<li><code>g</code>$\rightarrow$ a playable game</li>
<li><code>s</code>$\rightarrow$ a story</li>
<li><code>n</code>$\rightarrow$ a note </li>
</ul>
<h2>Build System</h2>
<p>As I mentioned I want to make my own build system for this website. My plan is to use a custom <code>siteGen.py</code> script to generate my website. </p>
<p>The most critical function of this script is: </p>
<ul>
<li>Read all the markdown files in the sites markdown directory and then convert them to html documents. </li>
</ul>
<p>Some other cool features I can think of off the top of my head are</p>
<ul>
<li>Enforcing the file naming convention </li>
<li>Checking all the md files for spelling and grammar mistakes </li>
<li>Helping fix broken links on the website</li>
</ul>
<p>So the basic steps in my build process will be:</p>
<ol>
<li>run <code>siteGen.py</code></li>
<li>use <code>git</code> to add and commit changes</li>
<li>use <code>git</code> to push my new code to my repo making like on the site</li>
</ol>
<p>If I use a <a href="https://endler.dev/2017/makefiles/"><code>Makefile</code></a> for this process I should be able to set couple rules for building and not pushing if I just want to look at the webpages locally before making them live. </p>
