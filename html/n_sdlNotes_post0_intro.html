<h1>SDL Notes</h1>
<h2>Steps to display something on the screen with SDL</h2>
<p>In order to display an image on your screen with SDL you must follow the following general steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Initialize SDL </li>
<li>Create a valid SDL window</li>
<li>Create a valid SDL Renderer(optional as you can blit surfaces directly , but you usally want this)</li>
<li>Load an image into a <code>SDL_Surface</code></li>
<li>Convert into a <code>SDL_Surface</code> into an optimized <code>SDL_Surface</code> or into a <code>SDL_Texture</code><ul>
<li>see the Surfaces vs Textures section for more info</li>
<li>THis is also technically optional as you can blit a raw surface to your window, but I don't think there are many practial reasons to do that</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Free the old raw SDL_Surface is no longer needed</li>
<li>Clear the Screen</li>
<li>Render the texture</li>
<li>Destroy the Texuture, Renderer, and Window</li>
<li>Quit SDL</li>
</ol>
<h2>Global variables</h2>
<p>In a lot of tutorials the author makes the a global <code>SDL_Window</code> and <code>SDL_Renderer</code>. This saves some time for a quick small program, but I think it would make it pretty difficult to debug larger programs. For that reason I will try to rewrite example ode to not use any global variables. </p>
<h2>The Window</h2>
<p>The <code>SDL_Window</code> is basically a container for everything you want to display on the screen. </p>
<h2>Screen</h2>
<h2>Surfaces vs Textures</h2>
<p>SDL defines both <code>SDL_Surface</code> and <code>SDL_Texture</code> for rendering images to your screen. </p>
<p>For a good description of thier difference see this <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21392755/difference-between-surface-and-%20texture-sdl-general">stack overflow post</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>SDL_Texture</code>: Is allows for <strong>hardware</strong>(GPU) rendering of an image. Basically stores your image in VRAM and uses whater GPU to render the images very quickly. </li>
<li><code>SDL_Surface</code>: Is uses <strong>software</strong>(CPU) rendering of an image. Stores the image data in normal RAM. </li>
</ul>
<p>Normally its best to use the <code>SDL_Texture</code> for the increased rendering spees, but if you need direct memory acess to the image you are displaying you may want to consider <code>SDL_Surface</code> .</p>
<h2>Game Loop</h2>
<p>pikuma has an excellent tutorial on youtube explaining makeing a game loop in C using the SDL library. He explains what he is doing and why, instead of just showing code with little explination. </p>
<p>He actually covers everything from installing SDL all the way to implementing a simple game loop. The first 30 minutes are a bit slow, but that is almost all just talking about how to setup SDL on a windows computer. If you are on linux it is a very quik setup. </p>
