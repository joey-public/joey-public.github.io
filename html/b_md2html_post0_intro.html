<h1>Using Python Create a Custom Markdown to HTML tool</h1>
<p>I want to create a custom tool to convert markdown notes into HTML files that can be viewed in the browser. This will be a simple tool, and the goal is more to learn and practice some python coding. </p>
<p>If you are looking for a tool that just works then you should really consider using <code>pandoc</code>. You can use this tool to convert your markdown files into <code>.html</code>, <code>.pdf</code>, <code>.docx</code>, or almost any format you can imagine. I have used it before and it is an excellent tool and much much better than anything I could possibly make. </p>
<p>Still I like to work on little projects and I think it would be fun to implement my own custom tool for this task that does just exactly what I want it to do and nothing more. </p>
<p>I plan to make a few blog posts about this project to get it into a basic working state. Once the tool is workable then I will use it to do all of the markdown to html conversion for posts on my site! As I use the tool if there are features I wish it had, I will try to add them one by one and do my best to also create a blog post for each new feature. </p>
<p>So to get started lets list out some of the basic requirements for our tool:</p>
<ul>
<li>Support for basic Markdown Syntax</li>
<li>Support for inline HTML</li>
<li>Support for math </li>
</ul>
<p>In the next post I will cover <a href="./b_md2html_post1_pythonsetup.md">Setting up a python enviornment</a></p>
