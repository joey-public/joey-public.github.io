<h1>Custom md2html: A Simple Markdown to html Tool</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>I want to create a custom tool to convert markdown notes into HTML files that can be viewed in the browser. This will be a simple tool, and the goal is more to learn and practice some python coding. </p>
<p>If you are looking for a tool that just works then you should really consider using <a href="https://pandoc.org/"><code>pandoc</code></a>. You can use this tool to convert your markdown files into <code>.html</code>, <code>.pdf</code>, <code>.docx</code>, or almost any format you can imagine. I have used it before and it is an excellent tool and much much better than anything I could possibly make. </p>
<p>I plan to make a few posts about this project to get it into a basic working state. Once the tool is workable then I will use it to do all of the markdown to html conversion for posts on my site! As I use the tool if there are features I wish it had, I will try to add them one by one and do my best to also create a blog post for each new feature. </p>
<h2>Requirements</h2>
<p>To get started lets define the most basic requirements of the tool:</p>
<ul>
<li>Run from command line <code>python md2html &lt;input_md_file_path&gt; &lt;output_html_dir&gt;</code></li>
<li>Take in a plane text markdown file and convert it to a html file that can be rendered in any browser </li>
<li>Support for basic Markdown Syntax <ul>
<li>for Headers, paragraphs, bullet lists, numbered lists, code blocks, bold, italic</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Support for math <ul>
<li>Using <code>$...$</code> for inline math and <code>$$...$$</code> for a math block</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Support for inline HTML<ul>
<li>As a fallback for anything we want to be in the html file that is not simple to represent in a markdown file.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>In this post we introduced the project ideas for a markdown to html converter tool, and defined the basic requirements we want the tool to have.</p>
<p>In the next post I will cover setting up a python environment.</p>
