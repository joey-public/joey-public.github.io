  <em>
   Problem 1.14:
  </em>
  A designer has available voltage amplifiers having an input
resistance of 10 Kohm, an output resistance of 1 Kohm, and an open circuit
voltage gain 10 V/V. The signal source has a 10 Kohm resistance and provides 10 mVrms
signal, and it is required to provide a signal of at least 2 Vrms to a 1 kohm
load.
 </p>
 <p>
  a.) How many amplifier stages are required?
 </p>
 <p>
  b.) What output voltage is actually obtained?
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Problem 1.16:
  </em>
  A transconductance amplifier having $R_i= 2 k\Omega$, $G_m = 40
mA/V$, and $R_O = 20 k \Omega$ is fed with a voltage source having a source
resistance of $2 k\Omega$ and is loaded with a $1 k\Omega$ resistance. Find the
voltage gain realized.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Problem 1.17:
  </em>
  Figure P1.17 shows a transconductance amplifier whose output is fed back to its input. Find the input resistance $R_{in}$ of the resutling one-port network. [
  <em>
   hint
  </em>
  apply a test voltage $v_x$ between the two input terminals and find the current $i_x$ drawn from the source; then $R_{in} = v_x/i_x$]
